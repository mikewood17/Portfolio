                                    I am a trainee web developer with a focus on front-end web development. Currently studing from home in Norwich Norfolk on the Netmatters Scion Coalition Scheme.

                                    My name is Michael Wood and I am an aspiring web developer. I didnâ€™t start my journey into the technological industry until late. Initially, I attended Sheffield Hallam University with dreams of wanting to become a physiotherapist but realised it wasn't for me. So I moved to Norwich and during lockdown, I started my first piece of coding by doing a javascript course on Udemy. This led me to where I am now, currently undertaking the Netmatters Scion Coalition Scheme. My reason for wanting to become a front-end developer is I believe it merges my two strongest skills which are creativity and problem-solving along with my passion for wanting to help people. I believe this comes from my keen interest in technology whether through gaming or creating digital art.
